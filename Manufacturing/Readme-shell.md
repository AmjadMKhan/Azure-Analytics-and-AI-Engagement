## Requirements

* An Azure Account with the ability to create an Azure Synapse Workspace.
* A Power BI Pro or Premium account to host Power BI reports.
* Please note that you can run only one deployment at a given point of time and need to wait for the completion. You should not run multiple deployments in parallel as that will cause deployment failures.
* Please ensure selection of correct region where desired Azure Services are available. In case certain services are not available, deployment may fail. [Azure Services Global Availability](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=all) for understanding target services availablity.
* Do not use any special characters or uppercase letters in the environment code.
* Please ensure that you select the correct resource group name. We have given a sample name which  may need to be changed should any resource group with the same name already exist in your subscription.

![Avg of ActiveSensors.](media/avg_active_sensors.png)

9. With Card visual selected, **select** the format tab.

10. **Turn on** the Title.

11. **Enter** 'Active Sensors' as the title for the card.

![Card Visual selected.](media/active_sensors.png)

12. **Turn on** Background and change the background color of the card.

Similarly, the color of the KPI value and title value can be changed from the Data label and Title sections respectively. You can use the Hex code #00222F to achieve the background color of the visual.

![Turn on background.](media/Background-Dark.png)

> Note: All other visuals of the report can be created by following a similar process.

13. **Click** on the 'Save this report' icon.

![Clicking on Save the report icon.](media/save-icon-click.png)

14. **Enter** the name of the report 'Racing Cars- A' and **click** on 'Save'.

![Save the report.](media/save-report.png)

 By following the same process for the 'milling canning' Dataset we can create the following real-time reports
- Milling Canning report
- Maintenance and Cost Analytics
- Miami Racing Cars
 
Once these real-time reports are ready we can pin them to the dashboard (by following the procedure explained in [Task 5](#task-5-power-bi-dashboard-creation)) to finally achieve the following look and feel.
